# hello-world
Working through using GitHub with the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.

The tutorial wants me to write something about myself here, but I'm not going to do that, mainly because I've never been good at describing myself with an elevator pitch. So, I guess you could say that I'm the sort of person who isn't good at describing himself, and who feels the need to explain that in a readme file that nobody will ever read... That probably speaks to some deep-seated mental issue.
